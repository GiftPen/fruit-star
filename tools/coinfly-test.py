"""A coin you earn has to be seen arriving. Two things were wrong: the coin was drawn on the
game canvas, which is exactly the board, so it vanished at the top edge -- the very direction
it was flying; and its speed was a per-frame step, so it was a ~0.6s flick that ran faster
still on a 120Hz phone. What is checked here is that a flying coin leaves the board, reaches
the chip, takes its time getting there, and that the counter waits for it to land."""
